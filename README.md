# 5th-challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler



## Description

<p>This project was created to create an application for Work Day Scheduler. It contains notes on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day that meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.</p>
<p>I learned how to use day.js to show current day and time. Also I got used to the way storing object in local storage, and getting the object from local storage and use it .</p>


## Installation

N/A


## Usage
<p>To understand the code that I code, please read the comments in JavaScript file.</p><br>

<p>The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.</p>
<p>Time blocks is presented for standard business hours (9am ~ 5pm).</p>
<p>If you view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).</p>
<p>You can type your 'to do list' on each time block and save it by click save button.</p>
<p>When you refresh the page and the 'to do list' persist in time block.</p><br>
